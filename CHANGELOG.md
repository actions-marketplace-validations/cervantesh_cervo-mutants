# Changelog

All notable changes to CervoMutants should be recorded here.

The format is intentionally simple:

- keep newest versions first
- add a `docs/upgrade-notes/<version>.md` file before tagging a release
- keep entries grounded in merged behavior, not roadmap intent

## [Unreleased]

- No unreleased entries yet.

## [v0.4.5] - 2026-08-07

### Added

- `cervomut run` now evaluates baseline and CI gate policy at end of run and
  records a structured `gate` evaluation on the public report (#368).
- `cmd/actionhelper validate-report-content` checks mutation-report.json for
  schema/summary content, and CI/Action smoke uses it so empty or degraded
  reports fail even when the file exists (#364).
- Shared `pkg/report/reporttest` fixture harness and expanded public-report
  goldens/contract matrices for report and CLI surfaces (#352–#363).

### Changed

- Gate failures return exit code `1` for every named gate check (`fail_under`,
  `baseline_regression`, `baseline_new_survivors`, `timed_out`,
  `compile_error`), not only messages that happen to contain "threshold" (#368).
- Struct-tag mutants from `string-empty-literals` / `literals` can override
  `equivalent_risk` to `high` when emptying the tag is provably equivalent
  (yaml name matches decoder default, no options; empty json names only). Non-
  empty json names are never treated as equivalent because of tag-dominance
  collision rules in `encoding/json` (#375).

### Fixed

- Import-path string literals are no longer mutated into `import ""`, which
  could only ever produce compile errors and deflated the mutation score (#374).

### Documentation

- Live install and GitHub Action docs pin `v0.4.5` as the latest public release.

### Verification

- `go test ./pkg/mutator/... ./pkg/report/... ./cmd/actionhelper/`
- `go test ./cmd/cervomut/ -skip TestEvalCommandWritesEvaluationArtifacts`
- `go run ./cmd/releasehelper notes --version v0.4.5 --out .tmp/release-notes-v0.4.5.md`

## [v0.4.4] - 2026-06-27

### Changed

- The root GitHub Action now declares Marketplace-ready metadata through
  `author`, `branding.icon`, and `branding.color` in `action.yml`, which keeps
  the action contract unchanged while allowing GitHub Marketplace publication.

### Documentation

- Updated the live install and GitHub Action docs to pin `v0.4.4` as the
  latest public release and aligned the released external-wave manifest default
  used by the hosted validation workflow.

### Verification

- `go test ./...`
- `go run ./cmd/releasehelper verify-compat`
- `go run ./cmd/releasehelper notes --version v0.4.4 --out .tmp/release-notes-v0.4.4.md`

## [v0.4.3] - 2026-06-20

### Changed

- The hosted external-wave workflow now supports optional manifest-driven
  module prewarm so dependency-heavy targets can run an explicit `go mod
  download` step before mutation execution when needed.
- Hosted wave result and aggregate summary helpers are now decoupled from the
  action version under test, so newer workflow metadata can still summarize
  runs that intentionally pin older released action refs such as `v0.4.2`.

### Documentation

- Published dated hosted validation notes and committed summary artifacts for:
  - the Prometheus medium-service prewarm validation wave
  - the `v0.4.2` helper-compatibility rerun after helper/action-source
    decoupling

### Verification

- `go run ./cmd/releasehelper verify-compat`
- `go run ./cmd/releasehelper notes --version v0.4.3 --out .tmp/release-notes-v0.4.3.md`

## [v0.4.2] - 2026-06-19

### Changed

- Hosted external-wave result and summary generation now run through tested Go
  helpers in `cmd/actionhelper` instead of large inline workflow scripts.
- The hosted external-wave workflow now runs those helper commands from the
  checked-out source module, fixing the post-`#278` working-directory
  regression on GitHub-hosted runners.

### Documentation

- Published a dated current-main hosted-wave verification note and committed
  aggregate summary artifact for the post-hardening rerun after the helper-path
  repair.

### Verification

- `go run ./cmd/releasehelper verify-compat`
- `go run ./cmd/releasehelper notes --version v0.4.2 --out .tmp/release-notes-v0.4.2.md`

## [v0.4.1] - 2026-06-19

### Changed

- Hosted adoption-wave summaries now distinguish raw recommendation entries
  from collapsed recommendation review units, and raw governance suggestion
  totals from per-status governance counts, which makes released GitHub Action
  evidence easier to interpret without hiding the raw totals.
- The published first-party GitHub Action now uses `actions/setup-go@v6`,
  removing the stale Node 20 deprecation path from the released action surface.
- Windows compatibility validation is more deterministic:
  pre-canceled pool commands no longer start real processes, and the serial
  runner budget/quarantine coverage no longer depends on real-clock races.

### Documentation

- Published dated follow-up notes for released adoption-wave recommendation
  review units and governance suggestion status counts.

### Verification

- `go test ./...`
- `go run ./cmd/releasehelper verify-compat`
- `go run ./cmd/releasehelper notes --version v0.4.1 --out .tmp/release-notes-v0.4.1.md`

## [v0.4.0] - 2026-06-19

### Added

- Semantic triage v1 with `pkg/triage`, actionable scoring, semantic grouping,
  actionable-only survivor views, and triage-aware report fields.
- GitHub-native review surfaces including SARIF, GitHub summary output, and
  first-party GitHub Action support for the standard CI path.
- Historical dashboards, recommendation surfaces, ownership routing, and
  baseline review lifecycle expansion for more durable survivor governance.
- Pool campaign orchestration, benchmark-corpus support, and committed example
  workspaces for small, medium, and large-repo adoption paths.

### Changed

- The public support story now includes an explicit compatibility matrix,
  additive compatibility policy, and daemon/worker narrowing as an
  experimental-only surface until protocol versioning exists.
- Release automation now verifies release notes, archive contents, checksums,
  upgrade handoff, `go install`, and archive-install report flows before
  publication.
- Public CI and release guidance now reflect the first hardened cross-platform
  validation lane on GitHub Actions.

### Documentation

- Added adoption guidance, rollout playbooks, maintainer operations guidance,
  adoption feedback intake, hosted-layer scope notes, and commercialization
  guardrails for the OSS core.
- Published the 24-month roadmap v2 and refreshed the project maturity
  assessment against the current repo-head evidence.

### Verification

- `go test ./...`
- `go run ./cmd/releasehelper notes --version v0.4.0 --out .tmp/release-notes-v0.4.0.md`
- `go run ./cmd/releasehelper verify-compat`

## [v0.3.0] - 2026-06-17

### Changed

- Hardened Windows-native mutation execution with safer temp-root handling and
  more conservative worker defaults.
- Added runtime warning metadata so reports expose selected temp-root and
  Windows execution caveats.

### Added

- Large-repo CI slicing mode with deterministic sharding and per-run bounds.
- Survivor-ranking calibration follow-up that reduces noisy comparator-boundary
  competition in review queues.

### Verification

- `go test ./...`

## [v0.2.0] - 2026-06-17

### Added

- First-class resource statuses in reports, including `memory_killed`,
  `skipped_resource`, and `pending_budget`.
- Structured failure artifacts for `run` and `eval`, including correlation IDs,
  `failure-debug.json`, and panic recovery.
- `stopped_reason`, `last_completed_mutant`, and per-mutant
  `memory_peak_bytes` in report outputs.

### Verification

- `go test ./...`

## [v0.1.0] - 2026-06-17

### Added

- Initial GitHub release for CervoMutants.
- Apache License 2.0, `NOTICE`, and trademark guidance.

### Changed

- Aligned repository naming, module path, and documentation with the
  `CervoMutants` public project name.

### Verification

- `go test ./...`

# CervoMutants

CervoMutants is a Go mutation testing toolkit built for CI, large Go modules,
and AI-assisted test improvement. It ships as:

- an importable Go library under `pkg`;
- a thin CLI, `cervomut`, under `cmd/cervomut`;
- stable JSON/JUnit/HTML reports for CI and agents;
- comparison tooling for Gremlins, gomu, and go-mutesting studies.

Mutation testing answers a different question than coverage:

> If this code is changed in a small realistic way, do the tests fail?

A surviving mutant is not automatically a bug. It is a signal that the current
tests either do not execute the behavior, do not assert the changed outcome, or
that the mutation is equivalent/noisy and should be governed explicitly.

## Current Status

CervoMutants is usable as a local/CI mutation runner and as an evaluation
platform. The project currently includes:

- AST/source rewrite mutators with stable mutant IDs.
- Temp-workdir and Go overlay isolation.
- Baseline-first adoption policy.
- Incremental cache and history files.
- Coverage/package/all test selection modes.
- Budgeted runs, deterministic sampling, and resume from partial reports.
- Strict quarantine and audited suppression rules.
- Summary, JSON schema v1, JUnit XML, and HTML reports.
- Survivor ranking and denominator-health reporting.
- Semantic triage v1 for non-progress loop timeouts, permission-mode platform sensitivity, and equivalence-risk survivor groups.
- Semantic actionability heuristics extracted into `pkg/triage` for shared use across engine, runner, and reporting.
- Engine orchestration split across dedicated files for execution, checkpointing, history, summary, slicing, and mutation scheduling.
- CLI orchestration split across command-family files for run/eval, compare/pool, baseline/report, and shared entrypoint dispatch.
- Experimental daemon/worker JSON-lines mode for internal protocol exploration.
- External-tool comparison normalization for apples-to-apples studies.
- Benchmark corpus harness for runtime, peak-memory, and mutation-throughput regression tracking.
- Pool campaign manifests that orchestrate smoke, compare, and benchmark jobs under one resumable summary.

## Install

Detailed install and upgrade paths for Windows, Linux, and macOS live in
[docs/install.md](docs/install.md).

From a Go workspace:

```powershell
go install github.com/cervantesh/cervo-mutants/cmd/cervomut@latest
```

From this repository:

```powershell
go build ./cmd/cervomut
```

## First Run

Start with the condensed onboarding path in
[docs/quickstart.md](docs/quickstart.md) if you want the shortest route to a
first useful report.

Use `doctor` before the first run. It catches missing Go/Git tools and warns
about Windows/OneDrive paths that can make mutation runs slower or less stable.

```powershell
cervomut init
cervomut doctor
cervomut run ./... --dry-run
cervomut fast ./... --budget 10m --sample deterministic
```

The default output directory is `.cervomut/reports`.

Do not judge the first run by the score alone. Check whether it produced
reviewable denominator health first:

- `effective mutants`
- `not covered`
- denominator warnings in `summary.txt`

Then check whether raw survivors and review workload actually match:

- `actionable review units`
- `semantic group review units`
- `test-recommendations.md`
- `governance-review.md`

If the first bounded run finishes but yields near-zero effective mutants or
mostly not-covered rows, narrow the target before you widen policy depth or set
CI expectations.

Healthy first useful reports can still look different from each other:

- `generated=10 effective=10 survived=3 actionable_review_units=2 semantic_group_review_units=1` means the lane found real work, but repeated boundary survivors already collapsed into one review-once cluster.
- `generated=10 covered=7 effective=7 survived=0 actionable_review_units=0 not_covered=3` can still be a healthy bounded lane when denominator warnings stay quiet; it means this slice produced no immediate survivor work, not that the rollout failed.

On Windows, `temp-workdir` runs now harden themselves automatically:

- they cap effective workers to `2`;
- they inject conservative `go test` settings such as `GOFLAGS=-p=1`;
- they prefer a temp root outside risky OneDrive-backed `TEMP` locations when
  possible;
- they expose the selected temp root and warnings in report metadata.

Important files:

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `.cervomut/reports/mutation-report.json` | Stable JSON report for CI and agents. |
| `.cervomut/reports/summary.txt` | Human-readable run summary. |
| `.cervomut/reports/junit.xml` | CI test report format. |
| `.cervomut/reports/index.html` | Filterable survivor review workbench with raw-report fallback, diff browsing, and client-side triage filters. |
| `.cervomut/reports/mutation-report.sarif` | GitHub code-scanning friendly mutation findings. |
| `.cervomut/reports/github-summary.md` | Compact GitHub step summary markdown for PR/Actions views, including owner routing when configured. |
| `.cervomut/reports/history-dashboard.json` | Structured multi-run history snapshot for raw score, actionable score, survivor aging, timeout movement, and operator yield. |
| `.cervomut/reports/history-dashboard.html` | Human-readable historical dashboard built from persisted run history. |
| `.cervomut/reports/test-recommendations.md` | Actionable next-test queue derived from nearby tests, coverage source, operator family, survivor history, and optional owner routing. |
| `.cervomut/reports/governance-review.md` | Human-readable suppression/quarantine review pack with generated templates and expiry guidance. |
| `.cervomut/reports/governance-review.json` | Auditable structured export for suppression/quarantine review workflows. |
| `.cervomut/reports/survivors-actionable.txt` | Optional actionable-only survivor review view. |
| `.cervomut/reports/semantic-triage-ledger.json` | Auditable skip/quarantine suggestions for known noisy patterns. |
| `.cervomut/reports/partial-mutation-report.json` | Checkpoint report for timeout/interrupted runs. |
| `.cervomut/reports/partial-summary.json` | Small checkpoint summary. |
| `.cervomut/history.json` | Historical survivor/cache signal. |
| `.cervomut/baseline.json` | Accepted baseline for regression gates. |
| `.cervomut/baseline.candidate.json` | Optional accepted baseline candidate waiting for promotion. |
| `.cervomut/quarantine.json` | Temporary audited quarantine entries. |

The public JSON, JUnit, and HTML report formats are treated as compatibility
surfaces. Golden fixtures in `pkg/report/testdata/` lock those outputs so
schema or rendering drift fails tests before release.

## Recommended CI Flow

Start baseline-first. Do not fail existing projects on a raw score threshold on
day one.

```powershell
cervomut fast ./... --scope changed --since origin/main --budget 10m --sample deterministic
```

Then store or compare the baseline:

```powershell
cervomut baseline update
cervomut baseline compare
```

For a more review-oriented flow, accept a candidate and then promote it
intentionally:

```powershell
cervomut baseline diff
cervomut baseline accept
cervomut baseline promote
```

When baseline gating is enabled, `cervomut run` now enforces it directly:
- `baseline.fail_on_regression` fails the run only after a real baseline
  comparison shows score regression.
- `baseline.fail_on_new_survivors` fails the run only after a real baseline
  comparison shows new survivors.
- missing baseline files leave those checks in a skipped state instead of
  failing first-run adoption.
- invalid or unreadable baseline files fail the run as an error instead of
  silently skipping comparison.

The default `ci.fail_under` is `0`. CI should usually fail on:

- baseline regression;
- new survivors when the baseline policy says so;
- expired quarantine entries;
- timeouts or compile errors if configured.

For GitHub Actions, the first-party integration path is
[docs/github-action.md](docs/github-action.md).

## Policy Presets

Policies are adoption modes. They set mutator breadth, selection behavior,
isolation, timeouts, and report formats.

| Policy | Use When | Mutators | Selection | Isolation | Reports |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ci-fast` | Pull requests and quick changed-code feedback. | `conservative-fast` | coverage + prefilter | overlay | summary, JSON, JUnit |
| `ci-balanced` | Regular CI with more runtime available. | `conservative` | coverage + prefilter | overlay | summary, JSON, JUnit |
| `comparison-safe` | Comparing against external tools. | `gremlins-compatible` | package | overlay | summary, JSON, JUnit |
| `nightly` | Scheduled deeper signal. | `default` | coverage + prefilter | overlay | summary, JSON, JUnit, HTML |
| `campaign` | Manual deep mutation campaign. | `aggressive` | package | temp-workdir | summary, JSON, JUnit, HTML |

Examples:

```powershell
cervomut run ./... --policy ci-balanced --max-mutants 100 --sample deterministic
cervomut run . --policy comparison-safe
cervomut run ./... --policy nightly --budget 30m
cervomut run ./... --policy campaign --out .cervomut/campaign
cervomut run ./... --policy ci-fast --report summary,json,junit,sarif,github-summary
```

More detail: [docs/policy-presets.md](docs/policy-presets.md).

## Reference Examples

Three maintained example workspaces now live under [examples/](examples/README.md):

[docs/daemon-worker.md](docs/daemon-worker.md).

Common run flags:

```powershell
cervomut run ./... `
  --policy ci-fast `
  --budget 10m `
  --actionable-only `
  --max-mutants 100 `
  --slice-by package `
  --shard 1/4 `
  --max-files-per-run 20 `
  --max-mutants-per-package 10 `
  --sample deterministic `
  --workers 2 `
  --isolation overlay `
  --temp-root C:\Users\me\AppData\Local\CervoMutants\tmp `
  --test-timeout 20s `
  --coverage-prefilter `
  --resume `
  --max-process-memory-mb 6144 `
  --out .cervomut/reports
```

`--actionable-only` is a review view, not a suppression mode. Raw JSON, HTML,
and the normal `survivors.txt` remain complete; the actionable projection is
printed to stdout for `run`, available in `report survivors --actionable-only`,
and written to `.cervomut/reports/survivors-actionable.txt`.

`baseline update` remains the direct path for replacing the baseline in one
step. `baseline accept` plus `baseline promote` is the safer review flow when
you want a candidate file and an explicit promotion action.

`mutation-report.json` also carries an additive `summary.actionable` block so
consumers can read actionable score and triage-weighted survivor counts without
changing the meaning of the existing raw score fields.

When `sarif` is included in `reports.formats` or `--report`, CervoMutants writes
`mutation-report.sarif` for GitHub code scanning. When `github-summary` is
included, it writes `github-summary.md` and, if `GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` is set,
also publishes the same markdown directly into the GitHub Actions step summary.

`semantic-triage-ledger.json` is a companion artifact. It groups equivalent-risk
survivors, flags Windows-only permission-mode noise, and suggests quarantine
review for confirmed non-progress loop timeouts without mutating the raw report.

## Configuration

`cervomut init` writes `cervomut.yaml`. The defaults are conservative:

```yaml
version: 1
policy: ""
scope:
  mode: all
  since: origin/main
  include: ["./..."]
  slice_by: ""
  shard_index: 0
  shard_count: 0
tests:
  command: ["go", "test", "./..."]
  timeout: 30s
  baseline_required: true
mutators:
  profile: conservative
execution:
  workers: 4
  isolation: temp-workdir
  temp_root: ""
selection:
  mode: package
limits:
  max_mutants: 0
  max_mutants_per_package: 0
  max_files_per_run: 0
cache:
  enabled: true
  mode: incremental
baseline:
  enabled: true
  fail_on_regression: true
  fail_on_new_survivors: true
ci:
  fail_under: 0
  fail_on_timeout: true
  fail_on_compile_error: false
quarantine:
  enabled: true
  fail_on_expired: true
reports:
  formats: [summary, json, junit, html]
  actionable_only: false
ownership:
  default:
    owner: ""
    team: ""
    contact: ""
  rules: []
```

`ci.fail_under`, `ci.fail_on_timeout`, and `ci.fail_on_compile_error` are
evaluated from the final normalized run summary after reports are written.
`--actionable-only` only changes review views; it does not participate in gate
decisions.

Supported selection modes:

- `all`: run the configured test command.
- `package`: rewrite `go test ./...` to the mutant package when possible.
- `coverage`: use a baseline Go coverage profile to avoid irrelevant tests and
  classify obvious `not_covered` mutants.

Supported isolation modes:

- `temp-workdir`: copy the module to a marked temporary workdir and mutate the
  copy. On Windows this mode uses a conservative worker cap and prefers a safe
  local temp root when the system `TEMP` is risky.
- `overlay`: use Go's `-overlay` support to avoid copying the module.

Optional ownership routing lets you map packages or files to the team that
should review actionable survivors first:

```yaml
ownership:
  default:
    team: platform
  rules:
    - name: cli
      file: cmd/**/*.go
      owner: cli-owner
      team: developer-experience
      contact: "@dx"
    - name: fs
      package: ./pkg/fs
      owner: fs-owner
      team: storage
```

When configured, ownership metadata is copied into each mutant and surfaced in
JSON, `report survivors`, the HTML workbench, test recommendations,
governance-review templates, SARIF properties, and GitHub step summaries.

## Large-Repo Slicing

Large repositories can cut one broad run into smaller, resumable slices without
hiding the raw report model.

Available controls:

- `--slice-by mutant|package|file|function|operator` to choose the deterministic
  shard grouping key
- `--shard INDEX/COUNT`
- `--max-files-per-run N`
- `--max-mutants-per-package N`

Examples:

```powershell
# PR lane: one package shard with a hard file cap
cervomut run ./... --policy ci-fast --slice-by package --shard 1/4 --max-files-per-run 20 --sample deterministic

# Nightly lane: broader shard with capped per-package density
cervomut run ./... --policy nightly --slice-by file --shard 3/12 --max-mutants-per-package 25 --sample deterministic
```

Reports keep the applied slice metadata under the top-level `slice` block so
later tooling can merge shard outputs without guessing how the run was cut.

Windows note:

- use `cervomut doctor` before large native runs;
- override the temp root with `execution.temp_root` or `--temp-root` when
  `TEMP` is inside OneDrive or the repo tree;
- prefer `overlay` for broader CI and `temp-workdir` for deeper local/manual
  campaigns.

## Mutator Profiles

| Profile | Intended Use | Operators |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gremlins-compatible` | Apples-to-apples comparison with Gremlins. | conditionals, boundary, basic arithmetic |
| `conservative-fast` | PR feedback. | conditionals, boundary, basic arithmetic |
| `conservative` | Default high-signal set. | conservative-fast + logical, boolean literals, controlled string emptying |
| `default` | Nightly/default deeper signal. | conservative + nil checks, numeric literals, return bools, assignments, inc/dec |
| `aggressive` | Manual campaign. | default + broad literals, returns, loop-control, len boundaries |

Every operator declares risk, equivalent-mutant risk, compile-error risk, AST
node kinds, example diff, and inclusion reason. Use:

```powershell
cervomut list-mutators
```

## How To Read Results

The primary score is not enough. Always inspect denominator health:

- generated mutants;
- covered mutants;
- executed mutants;
- effective mutants: `killed + survived`;
- score denominator;
- not covered;
- timed out;
- compile errors.

This is intentional. A raw score can look excellent while most mutants are not
covered or timed out. CervoMutants makes that visible at the top level of the
JSON and summary reports.

Survivors are ranked by actionability using:

- equivalent-risk metadata;
- semantic-group penalties for repeated review-once families;
- non-progress loop risk classification for timeout-prone loop mutations;
- GOOS-aware platform sensitivity for permission-mode mutants;
- recommendation tier;
- nearby tests;
- exported function context;
- coverage source;
- history status;
- operator historical yield;
- suppression audit hits.

Actionable survivors also carry a structured `test_recommendation` block. v1
uses:

- nearby test files;
- coverage source tightness vs fallback/package-level selection;
- operator family;
- survivor history and age;
- target-OS sensitivity where relevant.

The goal is to answer "which test should I touch first and what kind of
assertion is missing?" without generating tests automatically.

Read raw survivors and actionable workload separately:

1. `survived > 0` and `actionable_review_units > 0`
   Start with `test-recommendations.md` and review the highest-ranked survivors.
2. `survived > actionable_review_units` and `semantic_group_review_units > 0`
   The lane is compressing repeated equivalent-risk families; review the group
   once before you treat each raw survivor as separate work.
3. `survived = 0` and `actionable_review_units = 0` with healthy denominator
   counts
   That is a valid no-action lane, not a broken run.

## Quarantine And Suppression

Quarantine is temporary debt, not a way to inflate score.

Quarantine entries must include:

- mutant id;
- reason;
- owner;
- issue;
- expiry;
- renewal count within policy.

Expired quarantines can fail CI. Quarantined mutants remain visible in reports
and do not improve the primary score.

`governance-review.md` and `governance-review.json` are the review companions
for this policy layer. They generate:

- quarantine candidate templates with suggested expiry windows and policy
  reminders;
- suppression rule templates with evidence and reviewer metadata;
- auditable exports suitable for issue comments, follow-up review, or external
  tooling.

Suppression is stricter. A rule with `action: suppress` requires confirmed
evidence and at least one reviewer. Lower-confidence rules should use
`report-only`, `lower-priority`, or `quarantine-required`.

`report-only` is an audit suggestion, not a hidden failure state. It usually
means "keep this visible, but do not treat it as mandatory test work until a
human review says otherwise."

Inline ignores are allowed only with reasons:

```go
// cervomut:ignore conditionals reason="generated contract covers this branch"
return value == expected
```

## External Tool Comparisons

CervoMutants includes a comparison harness because mutation tools do not always
mean the same thing by target, coverage, timeout, and score.

The harness records:

- manifest target;
- effective target;
- target mode;
- killed/survived/not-covered/timed-out/errors;
- test efficacy;
- mutation coverage;
- denominator health;
- status classification such as `ok`, `no_report`, `no_results`,
  `all_timed_out`, `not_covered_only`, `timeout`, and `watchdog_kill`.
- workflow study artifacts for review:
  `comparison-study.json` and `comparison-summary.md`.

Important rule:

> Do not compare `cervomut run ./...` with `gremlins unleash .` as if they were
> equivalent unless the harness records target normalization explicitly.

`cervomut pool compare` now writes three layers on purpose:

- `summary.json`: raw normalized row data for automation.
- `comparison-study.json`: repo-grouped study view with comparability labels.
- `comparison-summary.md`: quick human review summary for issue comments, PRs,
  and study notes.

Docs:

- [docs/evaluations/tool-comparison-protocol.md](docs/evaluations/tool-comparison-protocol.md)
- [docs/evaluations/comparison-harness.md](docs/evaluations/comparison-harness.md)
- [docs/evaluations/tool-findings.md](docs/evaluations/tool-findings.md)

## Windows, WSL, And Memory

Windows-native mutation testing can be slower and more memory-sensitive because
of process spawning, path handling, file copying, antivirus/OneDrive sync, and
external tool behavior. CervoMutants mitigates this with:

- conservative Windows worker defaults;
- `doctor` warnings for OneDrive, long paths, and network paths;
- overlay isolation;
- process-tree memory controls where supported;
- partial checkpoint reports;
- resume support.

For large local experiments, WSL2 on the Linux filesystem is usually more
stable than running under `C:\Users\...\OneDrive`.

Recommended guarded local pattern:

```powershell
cervomut run ./... `
  --policy comparison-safe `
  --workers 1 `
  --budget 10m `
  --max-process-memory-mb 6144 `
  --resume
```

## Library API

The CLI is intentionally thin. The importable engine API is the long-term
automation surface:

```go
result, err := engine.New(cfg).Run(ctx, engine.RunRequest{
    Targets: []string{"./..."},
})
```

Advanced integrators can extend the library without forking the core by
swapping or composing the built-in generator, suppression evaluator, and
survivor ranker:

```go
baseRanker := engine.DefaultSurvivorRanker()

custom := engine.NewWithOptions(
    cfg,
    engine.WithMutantGenerator(mutator.ChainGenerators(
        mutator.DefaultGenerator(),
        myGenerator,
    )),
    engine.WithSuppressionEvaluator(engine.ChainSuppressionEvaluators(
        engine.DefaultSuppressionEvaluator(cfg),
        mySuppressionEvaluator,
    )),
    engine.WithSurvivorRanker(engine.SurvivorRankerFunc(func(goos string, results []engine.MutantResult) []engine.SurvivorRanking {
        ranked := baseRanker.Rank(goos, results)
        return ranked
    })),
)

result, err := custom.Run(ctx, engine.RunRequest{Targets: []string{"./..."}})
```

That seam is intentionally programmatic and additive. The CLI behavior stays
unchanged unless you build a custom binary around the library API.

Important packages:

| Package | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `pkg/config` | Defaults, YAML loading, policy presets, validation. |
| `pkg/discover` | Modules, packages, files, generated/vendor exclusions. |
| `pkg/mutator` | AST mutators, stable IDs, inline ignores. |
| `pkg/isolate` | Temp-workdir copy and cleanup safety. |
| `pkg/engine` | Orchestration, scheduling, cache/history/baseline/report flow. |
| `pkg/runner` | Test execution and status classification. |
| `pkg/report` | Summary, JSON, JUnit, HTML. |
| `pkg/extcompare` | External tool normalization. |
| `pkg/daemon` | Experimental JSON-lines worker/daemon protocol code. |

## Design Principles

- Prefer actionable survivors over raw mutant volume.
- Make denominator health impossible to miss.
- Keep CI adoption baseline-first.
- Keep quarantine temporary and auditable.
- Preserve partial data on timeout.
- Normalize external comparisons before drawing conclusions.
- Make JSON stable enough for CI and AI agents.

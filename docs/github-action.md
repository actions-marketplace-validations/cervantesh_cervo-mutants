# GitHub Action

Tracking issues: #159, #182, #212, #256

CervoMutants now ships a first-party GitHub Action for the common CI path:
install the tool, set up Go, and run a bounded `cervomut run` mutation lane.

The current public action lives at the repository root as `action.yml`.

## Scope

The action is intentionally focused on the common mutation-run workflow.

It handles:

- setting up the Go toolchain
- installing `cervomut`
- running `cervomut run` with bounded CI-friendly inputs

It does not try to wrap every CLI subcommand. For advanced workflows such as
`baseline promote`, `pool campaign`, or custom post-processing, keep using
normal shell steps around the CLI.

## Basic Pull Request Lane

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v7
- name: Run CervoMutants
  id: cervomut
  uses: cervantesh/cervo-mutants@v0.4.5
  with:
    policy: ci-fast
    budget: 5m
    report: summary,json,junit,github-summary
    out: .cervomut/pr
- name: Upload mutation artifacts
  if: always()
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    include-hidden-files: true
    name: cervomut-pr
    path: ${{ steps.cervomut.outputs.report-dir }}
```

## Coverage-Aware Service Lane

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v7
- name: Run CervoMutants
  uses: cervantesh/cervo-mutants@v0.4.5
  with:
    policy: ci-balanced
    budget: 10m
    coverage-prefilter: "true"
    report: summary,json,junit,github-summary
    out: .cervomut/pr
```

## Nightly Lane With HTML And SARIF

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v7
- name: Run CervoMutants
  uses: cervantesh/cervo-mutants@v0.4.5
  with:
    policy: nightly
    budget: 20m
    report: summary,json,junit,html,sarif,github-summary
    out: .cervomut/nightly
```

Optional SARIF upload step:

```yaml
- name: Upload SARIF
  if: always()
  uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
  with:
    sarif_file: .cervomut/nightly/mutation-report.sarif
```

## Large-Repo Shard Lane

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    shard: ["1/4", "2/4", "3/4", "4/4"]

steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v7
  - name: Run shard
    uses: cervantesh/cervo-mutants@v0.4.5
    with:
      policy: ci-fast
      slice-by: package
      shard: ${{ matrix.shard }}
      max-files-per-run: "20"
      sample: deterministic
      out: .cervomut/pr-${{ matrix.shard }}
```

## Inputs

Common inputs:

- `go-version`
- `cervomut-version`
- `working-directory`
- `targets`
- `policy`
- `budget`
- `report`
- `out`
- `sample`
- `slice-by`
- `shard`
- `max-files-per-run`
- `max-mutants-per-package`
- `max-mutants`
- `workers`
- `coverage-prefilter`
- `actionable-only`

Leave `cervomut-version` blank for the default behavior: the action installs
the CLI from the same pinned ref as the action itself, or from the local action
source when you use a checkout path. Set `cervomut-version: latest` only as an
explicit override.

That resolution path is now hardened in two ways:

- ref normalization accepts standard GitHub tag refs such as
  `refs/tags/v0.4.5` and standard branch refs such as `refs/heads/main`
- blank-version installs prefer the checked-out local action source before
  falling back to a ref-derived `go install` target, which keeps slash-qualified
  branch names safe when the action is executed from its source checkout

The action also exposes `report-dir` as a resolved absolute output path so
follow-up artifact or SARIF steps can reference the chosen output directory
consistently even when `working-directory` is a subdirectory.

When that directory lives under `.cervomut/...`, set
`include-hidden-files: true` on `actions/upload-artifact@v4`; otherwise GitHub
skips hidden report folders and the upload completes without the expected JSON,
JUnit, HTML, or SARIF files.

## First Useful Signal Checklist

The first successful Action run should be judged on more than "the job passed."

Review these first from the uploaded artifacts or step summary:

- `effective mutants`
- `not covered`
- denominator-health warnings
- whether the run produced any actionable review units or survivor output at all

Then separate raw survivors from real review workload:

- `actionable_review_units`
- `semantic_group_review_units`
- `test-recommendations.md`
- `governance-review.md`

Treat the first hosted result as one of three different states:

1. healthy review signal:
   denominator health is understandable and the lane produced reviewable
   survivors or actionable review units
2. healthy retargeting signal:
   the workflow completed, but denominator warnings or `not covered` pressure
   dominate and the lane produced little or no actionable review work
3. workflow failure:
   the action failed, reports are missing, or the artifacts are incomplete

Only the third state is a pipeline problem. The second state is still useful
feedback, but it is feedback about target shape, budget shape, or candidate
selection rather than about the core engine.

If the first hosted run finishes but yields near-zero `effective mutants`, or
mostly `not covered` rows, treat that as **target-selection feedback** before
you treat it as a product failure.

Recommended response order:

1. keep the artifacts from the weak run
2. retarget the workflow with `targets` to a hotter package root or bounded
   subtree
3. rerun on that narrower target before broadening to `./...`, adding more
   mutants, or judging recommendation quality

That sequence matches the post-release field evidence: the largest early
hosted-wave gains came from healthier targets and candidate choice, not from
panic-tuning semantic heuristics first.

The released hosted `v0.4.2` wave showed that distinction directly:

- `pflag-root` and `gjson-root` produced healthy denominator behavior plus real
  actionable review units
- `logrus-root` completed successfully, but mostly produced `not covered` rows,
  denominator warnings, and zero actionable review units

It also showed two healthy survivor-interpretation shapes that matter for first
time reviewers:

- `pflag-root`: `generated=10 effective=10 survived=3 actionable_review_units=3`
  is a straightforward review lane
- `gjson-root`: `generated=10 effective=10 survived=3 actionable_review_units=2 semantic_group_review_units=1`
  means repeated boundary survivors were already compressed into one review-once
  group
- `prometheus-labels`: `generated=10 covered=7 effective=7 survived=0 actionable_review_units=0 not_covered=3`
  is still a healthy bounded result when denominator warnings stay quiet; it is
  a no-action lane, not a workflow failure

If `survived` is higher than `actionable_review_units`, do not assume the
action is noisy. Read the grouped review output first. That is usually evidence
that the semantic triage layer already compressed equivalent-risk duplicates.

That is why the recommended next step for a low-signal first run is retargeting
before widening scope or judging heuristic quality.

For example, a first retargeted pass can be as small as:

```yaml
- name: Run CervoMutants
  uses: cervantesh/cervo-mutants@v0.4.5
  with:
    targets: ./pkg/your-hot-path
    policy: ci-fast
    budget: 5m
    report: summary,json,junit,github-summary
    out: .cervomut/pr
```

Once that lane produces healthy denominator behavior and reviewable survivors,
then widen the target or add nightly depth.

## Validation Coverage

The repository now backs the action with both unit and workflow evidence:

- `cmd/actionhelper` tests cover version/ref resolution and absolute
  `report-dir` output behavior
- the main CI workflow runs the composite action through `uses: ./` to validate
  the local action-source install path and the emitted `report-dir` output

## Versioning Note

The examples above now pin `@v0.4.5`, which is the latest public release of
the first-party GitHub Action.

For production workflows, keep pinning to an explicit release tag instead of
following `main`, and update that tag only when you are ready to adopt the next
released surface intentionally.
